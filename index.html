<div class = testimonials> <h2> Testimonials </h2>
<p>"I think they're very useful. Sometimes their corners hurt. I really like classic wooden tables—dark wood, mahogany. None of that fake stuff. I think the art of craftsmanship is dying. I really like looking at Carnegie-era craftsmanship, and I feel like that era of art is just dying. People are just content with making a square and calling it a day, and I just want people to work a little further. I think our fake-Harkness style pushes it, but not quite enough." -Chenault Ellis </p>

 <p> "What is there to say about tables? I like the combination of a table and one of those standing desks. I do my best work while standing (at least while typing). I feel like I'm more distracted with sitting down. That may have more to do with chairs, but I think the combination standing and tables really makes a special learning environment." -Kris Aziabor </p>

  <p> "I love tables. They serve society well." -Laura Ospina </p>

  <p> "I've been thinking about this one. I love coffee table books. I think they're the best part of tables." -Emiliano Caceres Manzano </p>

  <p> "I like when they're big. And I like when they're wooden. I like when there are little grooves. I like rustic designs. Not dinner tables, but like working tables. Just big slabs of wood." -Mateo Schnieder

  <p> "Tables are my passion. 'Christine, what does that even mean?'' you may ask—and it means just that. For as long as I can remember, tables have been part of my life, whether it was eating Christmas dinner with my family at the oak wood dining room table or playing a round of Go Fish atop the Lightning McQueen matching table-chair set from Toys R Us (rip). However, the first time I truly appreciated the utter beauty of tables was in 1st grade art class. We were tasked with tackling the difficult lesson of perspective, and what better way than studying the beautiful complexity of the table. I examined the small plastic table I myself sat at, Ticonderoga #2 pencil in one hand, a blank piece of printer paper in the other. I furrowed just brow and licked my lips and got to work: drawing the perfect table." -Christine Michael
